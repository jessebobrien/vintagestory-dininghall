build-and-install.ps1

Automates building the mod and installing the produced DLL into your Vintage Story Mods folder.

Usage:
  .\build-and-install.ps1 [-GamePath <path>] [-ModsPath <path>] [-ForceStubs]

If a valid Vintage Story API DLL is found (VintagestoryAPI.dll) in common install locations or the provided -GamePath,
the script will copy it to ./libs and build against the real API. Otherwise it falls back to a STUBS build.
